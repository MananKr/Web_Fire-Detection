# Web_Fire-Detection
This project is a real-time fire detection system powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A live webcam feed is processed through the trained CNN model to detect fire or smoke patterns with high accuracy. The system integrates a web-based interface that displays the live video stream, detection status, and system controls.
