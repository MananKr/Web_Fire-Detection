# Camera-Based Web_Fire-Detection
This project presents a real-time Camera-based fire detection system using computer vision and embedded systems. A YOLO-based deep learning model detects fire from live video streams. The Flask framework provides a web interface for monitoring, while Arduino hardware handles physical alerts and indicators. The system is designed for fast response, reliability, and remote monitoring.
